Section A
(Compulsory)
(a) Consider a scenario where 6000 patients are tested
for Covid positive. Out of which 5000 are actually
Covid negative and 1000 are actually Covid
positive. For covid positive patients the test
however gave positive indication for 700 only and
for covid negative patients, the test gave positive
indication for 200 patients. Construct a confusion
matrix for above scenario and find the values of
True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rato
(FPR), Specificity, Sensitivity metrics.
(b) Answer the following:

(i) What is the impact of small dataset with
respect to large number of features?
(ii) For the given values theta_0=0.2,
theta_1=0.1, and theta_2=0.1; predict
values of dependent variable y for all
